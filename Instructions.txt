1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your server.
		If you are using windows download python from here: (https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. **Setting Up Dependencies:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you have saved the script.
   - Run the following command to install the required Python packages:

     ```
     pip install discord.py apscheduler pytz
     ```

3. **Configuration:**
   - Open the [CONFIG.PY] script in a text editor.
   - Customize the following variables in the script to match your server and preferences:
     - `TOKEN`: Replace with your Discord bot token.
     - `leaderboard_channel_id`: Replace with the actual channel ID where you want to display the leaderboard.
     - `leaderboardmessageID`: Replace with the actual message ID of the leaderboard message.
     - Update the `contest_channels` and `winner_channels` dictionaries with the appropriate channel IDs for different contest types.
     - Make sure the `themes.json` file contains themes for each contest type as needed.

4. **Running the Bot:**
   - In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script.
   - Run the script using the following command:

     ```
     python main.py
     ```

5. **Using the Bot:**
   - Once the bot is running, it will automatically handle contest announcements, submissions, and voting.
   - You can invite the bot to your Discord server and set up the contest channels as mentioned in the script.

6. The only thing you really need to update in the code is in the config.py file. This is where you will put your discord bot token.
If you are hosting this bot on SparkedHost, you do not need to install anything manually, they will do it for you so you only need to edit the config.
If you need any help, contact GPhilly on discord or join my personal discord at https://discord.gg/xkdt7KAtJf

7. To use the bot once it has been set up its as simple as /lfg [game(type whatever game here] [message(need 2 for ranked, etc)]
There are no other commands to this bot, just the one. When it posts the post, it'll include the name of the game you entered, the added details (message) with a little button that says "Join" which allows people to join your VC with a click of a button.
In order to run the command, you MUST be in a Voice Channel currently otherwise the bot will respond with "You need to be in a voice channel to run this command"
